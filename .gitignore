# .gitignore Template for Data Team projects on Bitbucket
# -------------------------------------------------------

# The following list of files should be ignored when interacting with Bitbucket.
# The are mostly related to R, RStudio and Rprojects.

en.html
de.html
fr.html

# First some pretty obvious files that are produced by R and RStudio:
# History files
.Rhistory
.Rapp.history
# Session Data files
*.RData
# User-specific files
.Ruserdata
# RStudio (project) files
.Rproj.user/

# Then you should NOT put the cache build by your markdowns on Bitbucket:
# knitr and R markdown default cache directories
*_cache/
/cache/
# Temporary files created by R markdown
*.log
*.aux
*.out
*.utf8.md
*.knit.md

# tex files are most often created by markdown documents, so no need to push (optional)
# *.tex (however in the folder we have a .tex (template) that has to be pushed!

# R Environment Variables
.Renviron

# Optional stuff, depending on project (just uncomment, if needed):
# *_files/	# these are the files created while rendering your markdowns.
# figure-latex/
# figure-html/
rsconnect/ # if you are the only one deploying AND do not deploy from a common account DO NOT push

# The gitignore itself can be ignored (optinal)
# .gitignore

# Then, you can add a directory or other files that you do NOT want to share on Bitbucket:
# my-to-secret-documents/ 	 # a whole folder
# the_secret_document.txt 	 # or separate files
